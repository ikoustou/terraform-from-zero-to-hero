# Exercise1
You did a great job Angel, I really liked it. 
Your code was functional and I managed to create the resources.
I have to mention that the solution of creating an "output" of the whole vpc instance was genious. Did you do that deliberatly or you didn't know that you can create outputs for specific arguments like vpc id etc. This was quite a bit of "advanced" skill to be demonstrated on first exercise :) :)

**Try to correct:** 
1.  Try to be as neutral as possible inside the module definition. if you name the module resources "exercise1" then all the instances created by that will have this "exercise1" inside their naming.
Of course later on, you will copy and paste the modules (I asked you to write them from scratch for the first 4 exercises) and you don't want to see this "exercise1" in every single project.
2.  Also try to create an optional map variable for the tags. Do not hardcode tags inside the modules.
3.  Try to understand which arguments are neccessary for the module definition.
