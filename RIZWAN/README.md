I was really impressed! Amazing progress for your first exercise. I was left with mouth open, really proud of you!!!

1.  I know that I asked you for the first 4 exercises to write the modules again and again till writing modules will become a natural habit.
Hoewever try to be as neutral as possible. So the logical name "vpc_exercise_1" of the "aws_vpc" resource is not very neutral because it points to exercise-1. Remember the ultimate goal is to copy the folder of the module into another project without any impact on the final result.
2. I need you also to create a variable called region so we can use it inside yours provider.tf. Remember if you need to create resources in different regions you have to create different providers. One will be the default and the other the "alias"
3. Try to continue and finish the ex-2 where you will remove all the "default" values from variable and you will create **dev.tfvars** files in each stage.
